# About Me

I am a PhD student at Ashoka University with a focus on Individual and Social Choice, Game Theory (Classical and Evolutionary). My research explores conflict resolution and group dynamics (migration), role of affirmative action.
I have a keen interest in understanding the theory of uncertainty and behavioural models of choice.
